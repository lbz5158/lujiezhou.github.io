I promote statistical thinking and teach data-driven methods for real-world challenges. My instructional style is primarily based on heuristic method of teaching that helps students bridge problems arising in practice and applicable technical solutions. In my teaching, I value establishing trust with my students through clearly laying out the expectations and building up to them step-by-step from the fundamentals.
